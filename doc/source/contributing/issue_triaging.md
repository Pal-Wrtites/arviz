# Issue Triaging

It is often intimidating to start contributing when you are new and don't know where to start. Or you would like to contribute but don't have the time to code but prefer helping out occasionally with issue triaging. 

The first step for you to get started would be to make sure you subscribe and get notifications of any new issue our team runs into. You can then chose to work on it at the moment or come back to it later. Staying subscribed will ensure you are notified whenever issues are created or updated and can therefore see where your help might be needed. 

## How to subscribe to ArviZ issues

If you are not familiar on how to set up notifications on github, please check the following - [Setting Up Notifications on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications).
Once you are set up, you can [view your subscriptions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-subscriptions-for-activity-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions) and [manage your subscritions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-subscriptions-for-activity-on-github/managing-your-subscriptions) to ensure you are not being inundated with the volume and are getting notiifcations only to issues of your interest. 






4.	Explain how an occasional contributor can help with issues, without having triaging permission. This can include, but is not limited to –
    - Making sure the issue contains a minimal working example, if relevant. Sometimes, the issue doesn't contain an example, however, it is still clear about the problem. In that       scenario, someone other than the ‘issue author’ can generate an example.
    - Make sure the issue is clear and has references, if needed. Sometimes an issue is not completely clear. In this case,  the issue triagers can comment by asking for                 clarifications or adding extra references so the issue is clear enough for someone else to start working on it. For example - Ensure dimension order can be anything #1693         (whole discussion), Posterior plot errors with boolean array #1694 (comment)
    - Suggest fixes or workarounds. In some cases, even show that the issue has already been fixed on the development version but the fix is not yet released. For example -             az.summary ignores the parameter coords #1732 (fixed in main but not on release), Using Arviz with Pymc3 and Tkinter #1692 (requires triage permissions, label issues)
    - The importance of the issue can be highlighted by redirecting the user to  - https://ropensci.org/tags/labelathon or some of the references in there to show the importance          of this task.
